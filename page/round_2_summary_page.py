            ### Theme 1: Organ-Specific & Tumour-Specific Therapies

#### *Liver (Hepatic) Liver*
1.  A trial comparing *TACE alone versus TACE combined with thermal ablation* for medium (3-5cm) or large (5-7cm) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
2.  A trial comparing *portal vein embolisation (PVE) against liver venous deprivation (LDT)* for pre-surgical augmentation of the future liver remnant (FLR).
3.  An investigation into the comparative effectiveness of *conventional TACE (cTACE) versus drug-eluting bead TACE (DEB-TACE)* for HCC.
4.  A trial comparing *combined immunotherapy and SIRT, versus immunotherapy alone, versus SIRT alone* for patients with HCC.
5.  A trial comparing embolic agents for PVE, such as *cyanoacrylate glue versus particles and coils*.
6.  An evaluation of *cTACE as a rescue therapy* for patients with tumour recurrence after DEB-TACE.
7.  Research into the impact of *biliary obstruction and drainage methods* on FLR hypertrophy following PVE.
8.  A trial of a *doxorubicin and epirubicin TACE combination* for large, recurrent HCC.
9.  A study on the outcomes of *curative-intent liver ablation in borderline HCC patients* (e.g., ECOG 2, high comorbidity).
10. Research into how *hepatic arterial branching patterns* affect TACE/SIRT outcomes.
